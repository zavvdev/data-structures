# Singly Linked List

It is a collection of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. The last node in the list points to null, indicating the end of the list. This linear data structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations, making it a popular choice for various applications.

In a singly linked list, each node consists of two parts: data and a pointer to the next node. The data part stores the actual information, while the pointer (or reference) part stores the address of the next node in the sequence. This structure allows nodes to be dynamically linked together, forming a chain-like sequence.

**Operations:**

1. Traversal (visiting each node in the linked list and performing some operation on the data)

2. Searching

3. Length

4. Insertion:
    
    - Insert at the beginning
    
    - Insert at the end
    
    - Insert at a specific position

5. Deletion:
    
    - Delete from the beginning
    
    - Delete from the end
    
    - Delete a specific node
