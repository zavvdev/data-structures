# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the list, as the nodes are not stored contiguously in memory.

### Comparison of Linked List vs Arrays

Linked List:

**Data Structure:** Non-contiguous
**Memory Allocation:** Dynamic
**Insertion/Deletion:** Efficient
**Access:** Sequential

Array

**Data Structure:** Contiguous
**Memory Allocation:** Static
**Insertion/Deletion:** Inefficient
**Access:** Random

### Types of Linked List

1. Singly Linked List

2. Doubly Linked List

3. Circular Linked List

4. Circular Doubly Linked List

5. Header Linked List
